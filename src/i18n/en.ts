This internationally recognized charitable organisation works closely with local communities in need and has formed strong bonds of trust. As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continually worsens, the local population depends on organisations such as Islamic Relief supplying them with aid such as food and medicine. Islamic Relief has already distributed over 13 million warm meals and provided medical assistance to over 2 million people. In addition, they cooperate with the UN World Food Programme. Their psychosocial assistance is also essential, especially for children. We hope you'll join us in supporting Islamic Relief by tuning in and donating!",

Our donations went specifically to the Covid Aid Africa project, in which the LSVD and local partners supported queer people in Africa who, as a minority, are often particularly affected by crisis situations. They are scapegoated for virus outbreaks, which increases hatred towards them and causes them to lose their jobs or family support faster than others. There was also a lack of critical goods such as masks, disinfectants and hygiene products. To support these people, we were able to raise an incredible 2500â‚¬ in total at our first ever WoC thanks to your help!",
