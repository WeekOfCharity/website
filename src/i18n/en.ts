Our donations went specifically to the Covid Aid Africa project, in which the LSVD and local partners supported queer people in Africa who, as a minority, are often particularly affected by crisis situations. They are scapegoated for virus outbreaks, which increases hatred towards them and causes them to lose their jobs or family support faster than others. There was also a lack of critical goods such as masks, disinfectants and hygiene products. To support these people, we were able to raise an incredible 2500â‚¬ in total at our first ever WoC thanks to your help!",
